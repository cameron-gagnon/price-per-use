# Tech Stack Recommendation

## Overview
For the Price Per Use tracking app, I recommend **React Native with Expo** as the primary framework.

## Recommended Stack

### Core Framework
- **React Native with Expo**
  - Cross-platform (Android + iOS ready)
  - JavaScript/TypeScript familiar to AI agents
  - Excellent documentation and community
  - Easy development setup with Expo CLI
  - No need for Android Studio for development

### Language
- **TypeScript**
  - Better development experience
  - Type safety for data models
  - Easier for AI agents to maintain code quality

### Database & Storage
- **SQLite with Expo SQLite**
  - Local database, no internet required
  - Perfect for structured data with relationships
  - Excellent performance for small to medium datasets
  - Native SQLite support on both Android and iOS

### Navigation
- **React Navigation v6**
  - Standard navigation solution for React Native
  - Stack and tab navigation support

### State Management
- **React Context + useReducer** (for simplicity)
  - Built-in React solution
  - Sufficient for this app's complexity
  - Alternative: Redux Toolkit if more complexity emerges

### UI Components
- **React Native Paper** or **NativeBase**
  - Material Design components
  - Consistent UI across platforms
  - Good accessibility support

## Why This Stack?

1. **Non-Native Requirement Met**: React Native compiles to native components without requiring Java/Kotlin knowledge
2. **Local Storage**: SQLite provides robust local storage without any online dependencies
3. **AI-Friendly**: JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem is well-documented and easy for AI agents to work with
4. **Future-Proof**: Can easily expand to iOS later
5. **Simple Setup**: Expo provides zero-config development environment
6. **Performance**: SQLite + React Native provides excellent performance for this use case

## Alternative Considerations

### Flutter
- **Pros**: Excellent performance, growing ecosystem
- **Cons**: Dart language less familiar, smaller AI training data

### Ionic/Capacitor
- **Pros**: Web technologies, can create PWA version
- **Cons**: WebView performance limitations, less native feel

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Pros**: Can be installed like native app, web technologies
- **Cons**: Limited native device integration, requires browser
